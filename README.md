Python Scraping Practice
Azure Function Practice
Github Repos Practice

~ I do not support piracy. This is for practice purposes

I - Scraped the yts website for the latest featured movies
    - https://yts.mx/browse-movies/0/all/all/0/featured/0/all
    - get the:
        = movie title
        = year
        = download link

II - Arrange and set it up to be HTML based to have a readable output for the email

III - Deploy to Azure Functions
    - timetriggered every Friday at 6:00 PM where I usually decide to do a movie night or not

IV - Send the email message with the list


FUTURE PLANS

1. Practice scraping with images and include the movie posters in the email
2. Try and add multiple recipients if some people are also interested
3. Try other sources - TV Series, etc
